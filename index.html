            You have woken up after the craziest party of your life. While at first this day seems relatively normal, you realize that you're locked in a prison. However this is no ordinary prison. You notice that the walls are made of eroded stone, and instead of modern doors, there are very thick iron bars between you and freedom. You deduce that you've been teleported to the medieval era, based on your very little historical knowledge. 'You must useth thy brain to escape' is a phrase you can see written on the walls in what you can only hope and pray is red Koolaid. What is your first move?
